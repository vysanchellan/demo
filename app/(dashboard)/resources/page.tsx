      'Look for a nutritional adequacy statement (e.g. AAFCO or local equivalent) confirming the food is “complete and balanced” for your pet’s life stage.',

      'Worming schedules vary by age and lifestyle. Puppies, kittens and outdoor pets generally need more frequent treatment.',
      'Never use dog products on cats — some ingredients are toxic to cats. Always match the product to the species.',

      'Body language is your pet’s main way of communicating. A wagging tail isn’t always happy — context, stiffness and speed matter.',
      'Watch the whole body: ears, eyes, posture and tail together. Flattened ears, a tucked tail or a hunched body usually mean fear or discomfort.',
      'Cats show contentment with slow blinks and relaxed posture; rabbits “binky” (leap and twist) when joyful; birds fluff and grind their beaks when content.',
      'Learning these signals helps you reduce stress, avoid bites or scratches, and strengthen your bond.',
